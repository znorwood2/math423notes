<div class="para">This is a serious proof! Fix a triangle <span class="process-math">\(T\)</span> and put <span class="process-math">\(I = \abs{\int_{\partial T} f(z)\,dz}\text{.}\)</span> Also write <span class="process-math">\(\ell\)</span> for the perimeter of <span class="process-math">\(T\text{.}\)</span> Our plan is to bound <span class="process-math">\(I\text{,}\)</span> showing that <span class="process-math">\(I \lt \epsilon\)</span> for all <span class="process-math">\(\epsilon \gt 0\text{.}\)</span> Divide <span class="process-math">\(T = T^0\)</span> into four subtriangles <span class="process-math">\(T^0_a, T^0_b, T^0_c, T^0_d\)</span> by taking the midpoints of each of the three sides. As indicated by the picture, these four subtriangles can be oriented in such a way that</div> <div class="displaymath process-math">
\begin{equation*}
\int_{\partial T^0} f = \int_{\partial T^0_a} f + \int_{\partial T^0_b} f + \int_{\partial T^0_c} f + \int_{\partial T^0_d} f
\end{equation*}
</div>
<div class="para">It follows that one of the four satisfies <span class="process-math">\(\abs{\int_{\partial T^0_\bullet f(z)\,dz} \ge \frac{I}{4}\text{.}\)</span> Call that one <span class="process-math">\(T^1\text{.}\)</span> Notice that the four subtriangles are each similar (in the sense of geometry) to <span class="process-math">\(T^0\)</span> with edge-lengths halved, so <span class="process-math">\(\operatorname{perimeter}(T^1) = \frac{\ell}{2}\text{.}\)</span>
</div> <div class="para">Iterate this process. At stage <span class="process-math">\(n\)</span> we have <span class="process-math">\(2^n\)</span> triangles each of perimeter <span class="process-math">\(\frac{\ell}{2}\)</span> and a particular one <span class="process-math">\(T^n\)</span> with <span class="process-math">\(\abs{\int_{\partial T^n} f(z)\,dz} \ge \frac{I}{4^n}\text{.}\)</span> These triangles form a nested sequence <span class="process-math">\(T^0 \supseteq T^1 \supseteq \cdots\)</span> of closed sets of diameter tending to <span class="process-math">\(0\text{,}\)</span> so by Compactness there is a unique point <span class="process-math">\(z_0 \in \bigcap_{m\in\N} T^n\text{.}\)</span> We assumed that <span class="process-math">\(f\)</span> was analytic at <span class="process-math">\(z_0\text{,}\)</span> so, fixing arbitrary <span class="process-math">\(\epsilon &gt; 0\text{,}\)</span> we must have a <span class="process-math">\(\delta &gt; 0\)</span> for which the following inequality holds for every <span class="process-math">\(w\in  B_\delta(z_0)\text{.}\)</span>

<div class="displaymath process-math">
\begin{equation*}

<div class="para">Let <span class="process-math">\(n\)</span> be large enough that <span class="process-math">\(T^n \subseteq B_\delta(z_0)\text{.}\)</span> We rewrite <span class="process-math">\(\int_{\partial T^n} f(z)\,dz\)</span> in the following non-obvious way, using the fact that constant functions integrate to <span class="process-math">\(0\)</span> over closed contours by the FTC.</div>
<div class="displaymath process-math">
\begin{align*}

<div class="para">(In the second line we used the fact that <span class="process-math">\(T^n \subseteq B_\delta(z_0)\text{;}\)</span> in the third we used an ML inequality; and in the fourth we used the fact that the distance between any two points of a triangle is at most its perimeter.)</div> <div class="para">Putting everything together, we obtain the following.</div>

<div class="para">But <span class="process-math">\(\epsilon \gt 0\)</span> was arbitrary and <span class="process-math">\(\ell\)</span> is fixed, so <span class="process-math">\(I = 0\text{.}\)</span>
