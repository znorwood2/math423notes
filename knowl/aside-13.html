<aside class="aside aside-like"><div class="para">This actually requires a togological argument that we've swept under the rug. The gist of it is this: every point on a path from <span class="process-math">\(z\)</span> to <span class="process-math">\(w\)</span> has an open neighborhood that is included in <span class="process-math">\(D\text{,}\)</span> since <span class="process-math">\(D\)</span> is open. Only finitely many of these open neighborhoods are needed to cover the path by compactness. Now replace the portion of the path in the first ball with the straight-line path to where it exits the ball. Repeat with the remaining balls.</div></aside><span class="incontext"><a href="sec-cauchy-riemann.html#aside-13" class="internal">in-context</a></span>
