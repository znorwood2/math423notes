Notice that <span class="process-math">\(T\)</span> is completely included in <span class="process-math">\(U\text{,}\)</span> since every point on the line segment <span class="process-math">\([w,w+\Delta w]\)</span> is (by choice of <span class="process-math">\(\Delta w\)</span>), and since <span class="process-math">\(U\)</span> is star-shaped wrt <span class="process-math">\(a_0\text{.}\)</span> We can therefore apply our assumption to conclude that <span class="process-math">\(\int_{[a_0,w] + [w,w+\Delta w] + [w+\Delta w,a_0]} f(z)\,dz = 0\text{.}\)</span> On the other hand, this expression also equals <span class="process-math">\(F(w+\Delta w) - \int_{[w,w + \Delta w]} f(z)\,dz - F(w)\text{,}\)</span> so we rearrange to obtain</div>
